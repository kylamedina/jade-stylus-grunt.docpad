# A Jade, Stylus, Grunt Boilerplate for Docpad

Based on [this](https://github.com/lukekarrys/html5-boilerplate.docpad) and [this](https://github.com/docpad/twitter-bootstrap-jade.docpad).

Stylus includes Nib, Normalize v2.1.0, and a slightly altered Semantic.gs. A Bower component.json and .bowerrc file are also included.

## Getting Started

1. [Install DocPad](https://github.com/bevry/docpad)

1. Clone the project and run the server

	``` bash
	git clone git://github.com/kylamedina/jade-stylus-grunt.docpad.git
	cd jade-stylus-grunt.docpad
	npm install
	docpad run
	```

1. [Open http://localhost:9778/](http://localhost:9778/)

1. Start hacking away by modifying the `src` directory

## Grunt

Grunt will minify and concatenate all files in src/documents/js and create out/js/vendor.min.js

It can also minify CSS but I use Stylus so that's not really necessary.

#### `grunt-config.json`
- This file is contains the object passed to `grunt.initConfig` in `grunt.js`. It has been put into its own file since it is used in `docpad.coffee` to build file lists for inclusion in the layout and deleting unused files.

#### `grunt.js`
- This is the Grunt file. It runs `initConfig` with the `grunt-config.json` object. It also registers a `default` task with all the keys from the config file.

#### `docpad.coffee`
- These helper functions have been added: [`getGruntedStyles`]() and [`getGruntedScripts`](). They will return all the compiled assets that contain `.min.(css|js)` with the correct base path.
- A [`writeAfter`]() DocPad event. It is based on [this gist](https://gist.github.com/3898915), with some additional functionality. It will run the `default` grunt command. Then it will use your `grunt-config.json` to delete the `src` files since they are no longer needed. It will also delete any empty directories in the 'out/' directory.

### `layouts/default.html.eco`
- The script and style blocks have been replaced with calls to the helper functions described above.
